You must install the ember cli tools to run the project. 
Info available here: http://www.ember-cli.com/#getting-started

Then simply running ember server and going to localhost:4200 will show you the app.

I didn't get time in the two hours to get the cache working.
Everything else is working I think, but with no tests.

Ember gives you so much stuff for free, that it eliminates the need for a lot of boiler plate code for wiring up views etc. 

The power of computed attributes are shown where we can uppercase the name of the ancient from within the model.

I think the test is fair, and I think that any good developer should easily get at least a list of results on the screen.
I think having them do it in the office during interview is not a bad idea, but at the same time it does not really reflect real life scenarios where a developer can take their time to code to the best standards and also has time at their disposal to look for better tools.
